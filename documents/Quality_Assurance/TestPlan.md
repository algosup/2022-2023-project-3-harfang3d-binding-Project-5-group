# 1 Glossary

- <ins>FABGen</ins>: FABGen is a set of scripts used to generate bindings with other languages such as Python, Lua and Go
- <ins>HARFANG</ins>: Harfang is a 3D engine developed in C++ and it uses FABGen to have compatibility with other languages

# 2 Test Strategy

## 2.1 Test type

- **Functionnal testing**: these test will be used to verify that the software meets the [functionnal specification](../Functionnal%20Specifications.md).
- **Technical testing**: these test will be used to verify that the software meets the [technical specification](../Technical%20Specifications.md).

## 2.2 Scope of testing

### 2.2.1 In-scope

The following features will be tested:

### 2.2.2 Out-of-scope

The following features will **not** be tested:

- All the standards (like ISO, Misra ...) that some industry have to respect when using the HARFANG engine don't have to be tested

# 3 Test Environment

The test environment will be the following:
