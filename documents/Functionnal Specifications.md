## Overview 

The goal of the project is to create a binding in rust for the HARFANG 3D and their 3D engine, they have a binding generator called FabGen that already supports the binding for C++/python/Lua and Go.

The project is due to be done the 17th february 2023.

### What is HARFANG 3D

HARFANG 3D is a 3D engine written in C++ that is cross platform and open source. It is mainly used to develop industrial applications like simulation, data visualization, and Augmented Reality.

The approach of the engine is based on the openness and flexibility. It was created to fit the requirements of the industrial applications which consist in:
- No dynamic memory allocation (everything is pre-allocated)

### What is FabGen

Fabgen is a set of Python scripts to generate C++ binding code to different languages. It was written as a SWIG replacement
